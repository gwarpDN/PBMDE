# WHAT IS IT?
A slim and petite female character model mod for:
* Base races: Human, Night Elf, Draenei, and Blood Elf.
* Allied races: Void Elf, Lightforged Draenei, and Nightborne.

This mod is inspired by Cara Calena's (aka Redaxle) Petite bodies patch, and the continuation of my previous Petite Bodies Mods.

This mod is sponsored by a __Mysterious Patron__.
